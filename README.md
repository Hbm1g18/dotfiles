## Alacritty  
I have alacritty set up simply for font and colour scheme.  
Just a simple look to it I prefer to use. Now trying out ghostty however.  
## Ghostty
Ghostty is set up with catpuccin-mocha for a simple view. mainly just for trying out yazi.  
## Yazi
Yazi is using catpuccin-mocha theme and set for editing with nvim. Shows hidden files and mostly default for now.  
## NVIM
Set up with packer as plugin manager.  
Uses fugitive, harpoon, nvim-tree, telescope, treesitter.  
Kanagawa colour scheme used in nvim.
